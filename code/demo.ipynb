      "   Dr. Wulf H. Utian, a member of the Cleveland team that produced\n",
      "the world's first test tube baby using a surrogate in 1985, said\n",
      "the procedure ``raises numerous ethical issues.''\n",
      "   He cited questions over whether doctors should involve\n",

      "24 clinics in 10 countries, including the United States and\n",
